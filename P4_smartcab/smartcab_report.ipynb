    "## Implement a Basic Driving Agent\n",
    "To begin, your only task is to get the smartcab to move around in the environment. At this point, you will not be concerned with any sort of optimal driving policy. Note that the driving agent is given the following information at each intersection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next waypoint location relative to its current location and heading.\n",
    "- The state of the traffic light at the intersection and the presence of oncoming vehicles from other directions.\n",
    "- The current time left from the allotted deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this task, simply have your driving agent choose a random action from the set of possible actions (```None```,```'forward'```,```'left'```, ```'right'```) at each intersection, disregarding the input information above. Set the simulation deadline enforcement, ```enforce_deadline``` to ```False``` and observe how it performs.\n",

    "## Inform the Driving Agent\n",
    "Now that your driving agent is capable of moving around in the environment, your next task is to identify a set of states that are appropriate for modeling the smartcab and environment. The main source of state variables are the current inputs at the intersection, but not all may require representation. You may choose to explicitly define states, or use some combination of inputs as an implicit state. At each time step, process the inputs and update the agent's current state using the ```self.state``` variable. Continue with the simulation deadline enforcement ```enforce_deadline``` being set to ```False```, and observe how your driving agent now reports the change in state as the simulation progresses.\n",

    "## Implement a Q-Learning Driving Agent\n",
    "With your driving agent being capable of interpreting the input information and having a mapping of environmental states, your next task is to implement the Q-Learning algorithm for your driving agent to choose the best action at each time step, based on the Q-values for the current state and action. Each action taken by the smartcab will produce a reward which depends on the state of the environment. The Q-Learning driving agent will need to consider these rewards when updating the Q-values. Once implemented, set the simulation deadline enforcement enforce_deadline to True. Run the simulation and observe how the smartcab moves about the environment in each trial.\n",

Parameters in the Q-Learning algorithm, such as the learning rate (alpha), the discount factor (gamma) and the exploration rate (epsilon) all contribute to the driving agent’s ability to learn the best action for each state. To improve on the success of your smartcab:\n",

    "**QUESTION**: Report the different values for the parameters tuned in your basic implementation of Q-Learning. For which set of parameters does the agent perform best? How well does the final driving agent perform?\n",

    "> *ANSWER*:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I have changed the values of the learning rate (alpha), the discount factor (gamma) and the exploration rate (epsilon) and seen how the smartcab performed, analysing the success rate (how many of the rides ended before deadline) and the number of infractions committed (ilegal movements not following traffic rules).\n",

    ">For the simulations 1, 2 and 3,  I only increased the learning rate (alpha), the discount factor (gamma) is set to the a very low value and the exploration rate (epsilon) is 0 (no randomness). It can be seen that the success rate increases as the learning rate does, since the cab learns faster and more rides end before deadline. The number of infractions, is also reduced with faster learning (shorter rides result in lower possibilites of infractions).\n",
    "\n",
    ">For simulations 3, 4 and 5, the discount factor (gamma) was changed while keeping the learning rate (alpha) value to 1 and the exploration rate (epsilon) equal to 0. The discount factor determines how much importance is given to the past experience (Q) in order to take the next action. This means, if the discount factor is bigger, less importance is given to the present reward but more to the previous ones trough the utility. Hence, the number of infractions will be reduced (previous infractions have given negative rewards and we have learned from that!). However, aiming for low infractions and avoiding negative rewards we are following in the same amount the traffic rules (rewards) and learning from past experience (gamma -> Q), which results in  lower rate of success.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If we change the exploration rate (simulations 6 and 7), we are adding randomness to the following of the policy. This means, higher exploration rates (epsilon) will be reflected in higher number of infractions, since we will not be following the rules that maximize the reward due to the randomness introduced.\n"
