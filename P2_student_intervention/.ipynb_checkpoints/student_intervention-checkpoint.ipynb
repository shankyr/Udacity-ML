    "        - they create a model to predict a target variable or label by simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",

I used to think of it as a threshold but implemented with a really good function which will allow use to much more, as implementing gradient descent. And plus, it is roughly a preceptron!

    "        - is a special case of linear model, analogous to linear regression. The difference with linear regression is:\n",
    "            - as the dependent variable is binary, the conditional distribution $y|x$ is a Brenouilli distribution, not a Gaussian distribution\n",
    "            - the predicted values are probabilities, limited to (0,1) through the logistic distribution function\n",
    "        - **real world application:**probability of passing an exam vs hours of study. Also the breast cancer example, with age / size of tumor for women.\n",
    "    - Strengths\n",
    "        - simple, express dependency of the output variable with the features\n",
    "    - Weaknesses\n",
    "        - assumes output variable is dependent of all the independent variables, althought it may not be true \n",
    "        - linear regressions do not perform well for high number of features (we have around 300 students and 30 features, thats a 10:1 (student:feature) relation, which is very high).    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression\n",

    "    SVMs are appropiate when the number of features is high. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    What I really liked about SVM is how it is capable of finding boundaries between data even up to n-dimensions! The 2D explanation is very intuitive and we can see how different groups are separated by a gap. SVM takes it further and increase the combination of features taken into account in the decission. And, an amazing thing, is how space transformation (that thing we studied in vertorial calculus and complex maths) can be of good use to have an easily linearly separated problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Applications:\n",
    "        - they create a model to predict a if the sample belongs to one of the output target variable.\n",
    "        - they map the samples as points in the space separated by a plane with a large gap dividing the two classes.\n",
    "        - used for classification, regression and outliers detection\n",
    "        - **real world application:** data must be mapped with a clear gap as wide as possible. One example is facial recognition, where facial components are extrancted en combined into a single feature vector to be calssified. Previous examples are possible, since for the breast cancer  it is possible that if we plot age vs size of tumor for women, there will be a gap between young and older people and maybe younger are prone to be diagnosed benigne. \n",
    "    - Strengths\n",
    "        - effective in high dimensional spaces (lots of features),\n",
    "        - kernel trick: transformation of the space data can be separated. Versatile: custom kernels\n",
    "        - effective even in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "        - memory efficient: it uses subset of datapoints to find the decision boundary\n",
    "    - Weaknesses\n",
    "        - poor performances if number of features is much greater than the number of samples\n",
    "        - do not provide direct probability estimations. They must be calculated with cross-validation.\n",
